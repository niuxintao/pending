\begin{abstract}
Combinatorial testing (CT) aims to detect the failures which are triggered by the interactions of various factors that can influence the behaviour of the system, such as input parameters, and configuration options. Many studies in CT focus on designing an elaborate test suite (called covering array) to reveal such failures. Although covering array can assist testers to systemically check each possible factor interaction, however, it provides weak support to locate the failure-inducing interactions. Recently some elementary researches are proposed to handle the failure-inducing interaction identification problem. However, but some issues, such as unable to identify overlapping failure-inducing interactions, and generating too many additional test cases, can negatively influence the applicability of these approaches.

Incompleteness is dangous for its potneail harmful behaviour.

In this paper, we propose a novel failure-inducing identification approach which aims to handle those issues. The key of our approach is to search for a proper factor interaction at each iteration to check whether it is failure-inducing or not until all the interactions in a failing test cases are checked. Moreover, we conduct empirical studies on both widely-used real-life highly-configurable software systems and synthetic softwares. Results showed that our approach obtained a higher quality at the failure-inducing interaction identification, while just needed a smaller number of additional test cases.
